## Abstract
Vast stores of groundwater accumulated below the Earth's surface during the Holocene Epoch (i.e., past 12,000 years). Over the past 50 years, these non-renewable stocks have been depleted at alarming rates, largely to fuel the irrigated green revolution of global agro-economic development. Given society's reliance on groundwater, we build on the concept of 'peak water limits' to explore whether, when, and where humanity might reach peak groundwater usage. Using an integrated model of the coupled human-earth system with global coverage, we simulate groundwater depletion across 235 water basins under 900 plausible scenarios covering a wide range of human and earth system dimensions of global change over the 21st century. Global nonrenewable groundwater extraction demonstrates a distinct peak-and-decline signature across nearly all (98\%) scenarios, peaking on average at 625 km$^3$yr$^{-1}$ in 2050, followed by a consistent decline through 2100. This global pattern is driven by about one-third of global water basins (33Â±9\%), which robustly exhibit this characteristic peak-and-decline signature across most scenarios. A peak-and-decline signature characterizes most depletable natural resources, such as oil, gold and copper, and suggests the need for a paradigm shift wherein groundwater is carefully valued and managed as a depletable, rather than renewable, resource. Eventually, groundwater pumping as a long-term strategy for mitigating water scarcity is likely to diminish toward the end of the century. And water basins which are now heavily dependent on groundwater resources for meeting their demands will likely face increasing costs of groundwater and food production.

## Code reference
References for each minted software release for all code involved.  

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub user name.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.
